Remote login from one linux server to other
ssh <username>@<ip_address>
Login and perform some operations
ssh <username>@<ip_address> 'exho "hello-ansible" > /tmp/ans.txt'

Ansible have the capability to login multiple servers at a time.

Ansible uses SSH approach to connect the nodes

The server which having ansible is called Ansible server

from that server we can connect with other servers.

Installing Ansible:
CMD: sudo dnf install ansible -y

note: Ansible is a python dependency Application.

Connecting to other server by using ansible

CMD: ansible all -i <ip_address> -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> -m ping

Similarly for Installing an application or service

CMD: ansible all -i <ip_address> -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> -b -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed"

Shell Scripting == ansible playbook

Ansible playbooks are written in YAML files.

To perfrom a task by using Ansible playbooks

CMD: ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=<username> -e ansible_password=<password> <playbook.yaml file>

What are Ansible adhoc commands?

It is ansible comaand line to perform one time task or emergency tasks when we don't have time to write a playbook.

What are playbook?
Playbook conatins list of plays we can execute again of remote servers to perform multiple tasks. These can be written in yaml format.

Variable preference or precedence:-

For this we can test like provide same variable with difference message

1. Command line vars or args
2. task
3. file
4. Prompt
5. Play level
6. inventory

DATA TYPES:-

Facts are nothing but variables
Packages
1.Gather facts about the server
2. If os_familiy is red hat it will run dnf state name -y
3. If oc_family is Debian it will run apt state name -y

Functions == filters
Ansible functions are knows as filters in Documents

Piping 

CMD1 | CMD2

CMD1 o/p can be taken as input to CMD2

Ansible we can't create the function directly, we need to create these by using python
